# Weight-Lifting-Exercises-Dataset-Analysis
A project about machine learning
Data source : http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har 

This is an assignment from Coursera Data Science Specialization's Practical Machine Learning course.


Basically, I used 2 models and produced 2 reports, one for KNN and the other for RF.
You'd better read KNN report first. 
I include 3 plots to visualize the data and as an explaination for several successful classification algorithms on this project.:-)

Pardon my writing skills.
